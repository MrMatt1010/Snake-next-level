This is a Python version of the original Snake game. 

We will be adding at least some of the features below to the game



Use different levels with rising amounts of challenge. As the game goes on, you can add barriers or make the snake move faster.
Power-ups: Add things that give the player brief benefits, like making the snake move faster, making it longer, or letting it go through walls.
Special food: Make special food things that only show up sometimes and give the snake extra points or special powers when it eats them.
Keep track of the people with the highest scores: Set up a way to keep track of who has the highest scores. Store the scores in a file or a database and show the ranking.
5.Sound effects and music: Add sound effects when things happen, like when you eat food, hit something, or finish a level. Add background sounds to make the game more enjoyable.

Customizable options: Let players change game settings, such as the speed of the snake, the size of the screen, or the colour scheme, to their liking.
Two-player mode: Make a mode where two people can play against each other on the same screen, each controlling their own snake.
Game over animations: When the game is over, add animations or visual effects like an explosion or a screen that shows the score.
Bonus Challenge: Add bonus tasks or minigames to the main game so that players can earn extra points or prizes.
Mobile version: Change the settings and layout of the game so that they work best on touchscreens
